RaspberryPiSmartTarget
======================

The Raspberry Pi Smart Target was designed to be hit by the now famous Flying Monkey, but It can be hit by any other light object such as small ball. When the Target is hit the following events happen: A random sound effect is played through a small set of speakers connected to the Raspberry Pi. A "congratulations" message is displayed in the front LCD screen. The Raspberry Pi grabs a snapshot from a network camera (Dropcam) and is posted to a social network. A random message is posted along with the picture taken by the Dropcam. The whole action is immortalized in the interwebz.
